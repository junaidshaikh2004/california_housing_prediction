# 🏡 California Housing Price Prediction  

## 📌 Overview  
This is my **first complete Machine Learning project**, built primarily for **learning purposes** and to understand the **end-to-end ML workflow** rather than just building a model.  
It is also a **perfect first go-to project for anyone starting in Machine Learning**, as it covers all the essential steps of a regression problem.  

The project predicts **California house prices** using the famous **California Housing dataset** with multiple regression models.

## ✅ What I Learned  
Through this project, I practiced and understood:  
- **Data Understanding** – Features, target, and dataset structure  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Distribution, outliers, correlation, skewness  
- **Preprocessing** – Missing value handling, scaling  
- **Model Building & Evaluation** – Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest  
- **Model Comparison** – Evaluating R², MAE, RMSE and understanding overfitting vs generalization  

This project was both a **learning experience** and a **practical implementation** of supervised ML concepts.

## 📊 Results  
| Model | R² | MAE | RMSE |
|-------|-----|-----|------|
| Linear Regression | 0.57 | 0.53 | 0.74 |
| Decision Tree | 0.62 | 0.45 | 0.70 |
| Random Forest | **0.80** | **0.32** | **0.50** |

✅ **Random Forest Regressor** performed the best, explaining ~80% variance in house prices.
